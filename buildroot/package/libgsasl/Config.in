	  Simple Authentication and Security Layer framework Library.
	  GNU SASL is an implementation of the Simple Authentication and
	  Security Layer framework and a few common SASL mechanisms.
	  SASL is used by network servers (e.g., IMAP, SMTP) to request
	  authentication from clients, and in clients to authenticate
	  against servers.
