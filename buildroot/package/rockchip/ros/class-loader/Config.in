		The class_loader package is a ROS-independent package
		for loading plugins during runtime and the foundation
		of the higher level ROS "pluginlib" library.
		class_loader utilizes the host operating system's
		runtime loader to open runtime libraries
		(e.g. .so/.dll files), introspect the library for
		exported plugin classes, and allows users to
		instantiate objects of said exported classes without
		the explicit declaration (i.e. header file) for those
		classes.
