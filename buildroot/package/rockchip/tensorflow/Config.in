	help
		TensorFlow is an open source software library for numerical computation
		using data flow graphs. The graph nodes represent mathematical operations,
		while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors)
		that flow between them. This flexible architecture enables you to deploy
		computation to one or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile
		device without rewriting code. TensorFlow also includes TensorBoard,
		a data visualization toolkit.
