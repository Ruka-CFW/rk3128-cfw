	  systemd-bootchart is a tool, usually run at system startup,
	  that collects the CPU load, disk load, memory usage, as well
	  as per-process information from a running system. Collected
	  results are output as an SVG graph.

	  systemd-bootchart requires a Linux kernel >= 3.0 with the
	  following options enabled:

	  - CONFIG_SCHEDSTATS
	  - CONFIG_SCHED_DEBUG

	  These options will be automatically enabled by Buildroot if
	  it is responsible for building the kernel. Otherwise, if you
	  are building your kernel outside of Buildroot, make sure
	  these options are enabled.
